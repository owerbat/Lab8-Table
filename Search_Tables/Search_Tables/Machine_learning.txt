Machine Learning
What it is and why it matters

Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building 
It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from 
data identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention

Evolution of machine learning
Because of new computing technologies machine learning today is not like machine
learning of the past It was born from pattern recognition and the theory that computers
can learn without being programmed to perform specific tasks researchers interested in
artificial intelligence wanted to see if computers could learn from data The iterative
aspect of machine learning is important because as models are exposed to new data they
are able to independently adapt They learn from previous computations to produce reliable
repeatable decisions and results Its a science thats not new but one that has gained
fresh momentum
While many machine learning algorithms have been around for a long time the ability to
automatically apply complex mathematical calculations to big data over and over faster
and faster is a recent development Here are a few widely publicized examples of machine
learning applications you may be familiar with
The heavily hyped self-driving Google car The essence of machine learning
Online recommendation offers such as those from Amazon and Netflix Machine learning 
applications for everyday life
Knowing what customers are saying about you on Twitter Machine learning combined 
with linguistic rule creation
Fraud detection One of the more obvious important uses in our world today

Why is machine learning important
Resurging interest in machine learning is due to the same factors that have made data
mining and Bayesian analysis more popular than ever Things like growing volumes and
varieties of available data computational processing that is cheaper and more powerful
and affordable data storage
All of these things mean it is possible to quickly and automatically produce models that
can analyze bigger, more complex data and deliver faster more accurate results even on
a very large scale And by building precise models an organization has a better chance of
identifying profitable opportunities or avoiding unknown risks

Who is using it
Most industries working with large amounts of data have recognized the value of machine
learning technology By gleaning insights from this data often in real time
organizations are able to work more efficiently or gain an advantage over competitors

Financial services
Banks and other businesses in the financial industry use machine learning technology for
two key purposes to identify important insights in data and prevent fraud The insights
can identify investment opportunities or help investors know when to trade Data mining
can also identify clients with high-risk profiles or use cybersurveillance to pinpoint
warning signs of fraud

Government
Government agencies such as public safety and utilities have a particular need for machine
learning since they have multiple sources of data that can be mined for insights
Analyzing sensor data, for example, identifies ways to increase efficiency and save money
Machine learning can also help detect fraud and minimize identity theft

Health care
Machine learning is a fast-growing trend in the health care industry thanks to the advent
of wearable devices and sensors that can use data to assess a patients health in real time
The technology can also help medical experts analyze data to identify trends or red flags
that may lead to improved diagnoses and treatment

Marketing and sales
Websites recommending items you might like based on previous purchases are using machine
learning to analyze your buying history and promote other items you would be interested in
This ability to capture data analyze it and use it to personalize a shopping experience
or implement a marketing campaign is the future of retail

Oil and gas
Finding new energy sources. Analyzing minerals in the ground Predicting refinery sensor
failure Streamlining oil distribution to make it more efficient and cost-effective. The
number of machine learning use cases for this industry is vast and still expanding

Transportation
Analyzing data to identify patterns and trends is key to the transportation industry
which relies on making routes more efficient and predicting potential problems to increase
profitability The data analysis and modeling aspects of machine learning are important
tools to delivery companies, public transportation and other transportation organizations

What are some popular machine learning methods
Two of the most widely adopted machine learning methods are supervised learning and
unsupervised learning but there are also other methods of machine learning Here is an
overview of the most popular types
Supervised learning algorithms are trained using labeled examples such as an input where
the desired output is known. For example, a piece of equipment could have data points
labeled either F failed or R runs The learning algorithm receives a set of inputs
along with the corresponding correct outputs and the algorithm learns by comparing its
actual output with correct outputs to find errors It then modifies the model accordingly
Through methods like classification regression prediction and gradient boosting
supervised learning uses patterns to predict the values of the label on additional
unlabeled data Supervised learning is commonly used in applications where historical
data predicts likely future events For example it can anticipate when credit card
transactions are likely to be fraudulent or which insurance customer is likely to file a
claim

Unsupervised learning is used against data that has no historical labels The system is
not told the right answer The algorithm must figure out what is being shown The goal
is to explore the data and find some structure within Unsupervised learning works well on
transactional data For example it can identify segments of customers with similar
attributes who can then be treated similarly in marketing campaigns Or it can find the
main attributes that separate customer segments from each other Popular techniques
include self-organizing maps nearest-neighbor mapping k-means clustering and singular
value decomposition These algorithms are also used to segment text topics recommend
items and identify data outliers

Semisupervised learning is used for the same applications as supervised learning But it
uses both labeled and unlabeled data for training typically a small amount of labeled
data with a large amount of unlabeled data because unlabeled data is less expensive and
takes less effort to acquire This type of learning can be used with methods such as
classification regression and prediction Semisupervised learning is useful when the
cost associated with labeling is too high to allow for a fully labeled training process
Early examples of this include identifying a persons face on a web cam
Reinforcement learning is often used for robotics gaming and navigation With
reinforcement learning the algorithm discovers through trial and error which actions
yield the greatest rewards This type of learning has three primary components the agent
the learner or decision maker the environment everything the agent interacts with and
actions what the agent can do The objective is for the agent to choose actions that
maximize the expected reward over a given amount of time The agent will reach the goal
much faster by following a good policy So the goal in reinforcement learning is to learn
the best policy

Humans can typically create one or two good models a week machine learning can create
thousands of models a week

How it works
To get the most value from machine learning you have to know how to pair the best
algorithms with the right tools and processes SAS combines rich, sophisticated heritage
in statistics and data mining with new architectural advances to ensure your models run
as fast as possible even in huge enterprise environments
